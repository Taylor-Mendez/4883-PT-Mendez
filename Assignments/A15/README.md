## Your Take on a Problem
### Taylor Mendez 
### Description:

The problem I choose was a string 
manipulation problem. Originally
I attempted to solve it with 2 
2-dimensional array but time 
complexity was to large for both
attempts at solving with arrays.

The actual solution consisted of 
me using 2 2-dimensional arrays
and a map to store the encoded ->
decoded conversion
