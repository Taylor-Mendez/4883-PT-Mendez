## Sorting Experiment
### Taylor Mendez 
### Description:

Creating an experiment to compare the sorting routines we
discussed in class. I will vary the following about the 
data being sorted:
- size
- type: integers and strings
- discombulation of data:
    - completely sorted or random
    - reverse sorted
    - already sorted
