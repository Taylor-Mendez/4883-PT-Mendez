## 10055 - Hashmat the Brave Warrior
### Taylor Mendez 
### Description:

Hashmat is a brave warrior who with his group of young soldiers moves from one place to another to
fight against his opponents. Before Fighting he just calculates one thing, the difference between his
soldier number and the opponent’s soldier number. From this difference he decides whether to fight or
not. Hashmat’s soldier number is never greater than his opponent.

Input
The input contains two numbers in every line. These two numbers in each line denotes the number
soldiers in Hashmat’s army and his opponent’s army or vice versa. The input numbers are not greater
than 232. Input is terminated by ‘End of File’.

Output
For each line of input, print the difference of number of soldiers between Hashmat’s army and his
opponent’s army. Each output should be in seperate line.
