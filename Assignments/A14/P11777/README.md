## 11777 - Automate the Grades
### Taylor Mendez 
### Description:

Grading of the course goes as follows:
    Term 1 = 20%
    Term 2 = 20%
    Final = 30%
    Attendance = 10%
    Class (comprised of 3 tests) = 20%

    *note: out of the 3 tests, the final grade will only take the highest 2 test grades

    A >= 90
    B >=80 && <90
    C >=70 && <80
    D >=60 && <70
    F < 60


The program will output the final letter grade for each case in input
file
