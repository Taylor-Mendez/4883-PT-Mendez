## 10226 - Hardwood Species
### Taylor Mendez 
### Description:

This program will count the number of
trees in a population and will also keep
count of how many of each specific hardwood 
species are in the population and will then 
display each species in alphabetical order 
with the percentage of the population that
species makes up.

I used a graph structure to solve this 
problem
